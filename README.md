# FlixFinder

## Description

FlixFinder is your on-the-go source for movie information.

Type in the movie of your choice and read up on the main actors, check the movie length if you're short on time, see if other moviegoers liked it, and watch the trailer if you're still unsure.

If you've already seen that movie but are interested in something similar, you'll find move suggestions on the left-hand side of the screen.

If you want to revisit a movie you've aleady searched but don't remeber the exact title, don't worry, your last 5 title searches are saved for your convenience!

## Tech Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OMDB API for movie information, Google Youtube API for movie trailers, and TMDB API for similar movie titles.
